# zeroda-clone

Instead of copying it exactly, I used the original as a reference and created my own version with a few design twists.

🎨 What I did differently:

Dark theme background

Background image inside the login card

Labeled input fields (instead of just placeholders)

Bold, custom-styled heading (“login to kite”)

Unique spacing and font weight

✅ What I kept from the original:

Overall layout structure

Zerodha logo and button style

Footer with version info and support links

🧠 What I learned:

How to analyze a real UI and rebuild it creatively

Use of layout, fonts, and spacing effectively

Clean and responsive form design with just HTML & CSS
